# Monte Carlo Simulation of Reduction Function for Nanostructures

This repository contains a **Monte Carlo algorithm** for estimating the **reduction function** of nanostructures (nanowires, thin films). The model uses random sampling to approximate transport-related geometric properties.

## ✨ Features
- Monte Carlo estimator for reduction functions  
- Randomized sampling with configurable resolution  
- Nanostructure geometry generators: wire, plate 

- Example runs for different shapes and size parameters

## 📘 Theory (Brief)
The **reduction function** describes how the effective transport (e.g., thermal/electrical conductivity) deviates from bulk values due to boundary scattering or geometric confinement.

Monte Carlo sampling evaluates geometric path lengths and interactions to approximate this function numerically.
